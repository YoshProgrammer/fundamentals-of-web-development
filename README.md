## Fundamentals of Web Development

> Welcome.  If you are reading this, you have made the decision to become a proficient web software engineer.  This repository will help guide you through understanding the CodeUnion learning experience.

**The Web Fundamentals workshop consists of three important phases.**

- #### The On Boarding

- #### A Sprint to the CRUD

- #### The Creative Sandbox

**Your first step consists of a series of tasks, objectives and concepts that will allow us to 'on-board' you as though you were a junior engineer joining the CodeUnion remote team.**

CodeUnion organizes itself around a students who orbit a teacher.  The teacher holds two live, interactive sessions per week.  Teachers will learn, organize and challenge you as an individual, and as a member of a team.  As will be illustrated through code and content in pages to come, You will hopefully be afforded an organized, cohesive learning experience that uses code puzzles, tasks, challenges, creative thinking and group problem solving.  Along the way, we will begin to point your internal compass in the direction of developer.

These tasks, objectives and concepts will begin the educational transformation process that is CodeUnion.  Your first goal is to review all the tasks, objectives and concepts associated with the On Boarding phase.  Completing all the objectives and tasks associated with each phase will allow CodeUnion teachers to guide your progress.  The phases represent different goals and have distinct characteristics tied to purpose, format and content.  Completing phases within the timeframes specified will help you stay on track with the CodeUnion pace.  

**Above all, our structure will enable you to have fun while learning.**

## PHASE 1 - The On Boarding

> The On Boarding phase will ensure your technical environment functions appropriately. It will build your understanding of our code feedback cycle and it will begin your introduction to the concepts and tools that define web development.  A solid foundation and clear understanding of CodeUnion during the On Boarding phase will help you acclimate to our system of building technical skills.

#### Please attempt to complete the below tasks before the start of first day of the web fundamental workshop but at least by the end of the first week.

On Boarding involves a decent amount of 'grunt work'.  The work might seem chunky, unclear and overly complicated.  It is unclear, chunky and overly complicated.  We will help you on boarding.  Future weeks tasks will focus more on writing code and less on technical tooling but we must ensure you finish these tasks in order to give you an orientation with the relevents tools.
